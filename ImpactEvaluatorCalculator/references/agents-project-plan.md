# Objective
The goal of this POC is to build a minimal cost calculator for Impact Evaluation and Rewards System. I would like to use it to plot and compare different Retro Funding rounds. 
The final product would be a calculator that would support rounds and DAO managers to analyze and take decisions on the design of their IE.
The calculator will use the concepts on the paper [Generalized Impact Evaluators
](https://research.protocol.ai/publications/generalized-impact-evaluators/ngwhitepaper2.pdf) and the abstraction built by @aspiers in [Impact Evaluator](https://github.com/aspiers/ImpactEvaluators)

## Minimal Features
- [ ] components of the IE system, each one with possibility of receiving values 
     - [ ] first minimal set of values to be appended to each component 
- [ ] input system for value of hours or cost for each given component of the system
- [ ] minimal set of parameters for each component 
- [ ] visual rendered outcome

## Not part of this first 
- UI 
- Any external integration

## Expected tangible outcome ( must have )
- [ ]  a visual outcome containing 
   - [ ] the total  cost of one round using this IE
   - [ ] each component cost

## Wish to have outcome 
- [ ]  a visual indication of the most expensive components ( gradients , changes in color, size)
