# Onchain Recurrent Rewards Research & Development

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository contains the **research and development** of a project that aims to **map the current state of the public goods ecosystem** and contribute with possible enhancements to make it more effective and sustainable.

### What are Public Goods?

Think of public goods like roads, parks, or open-source software - things that benefit everyone but are often underfunded because it's hard to charge people for using them. In the blockchain world, this includes things like:
- Open-source protocols and tools
- Developer infrastructure 
- Educational resources
- Security research

### My Mission

I'm exploring **RetroPGF (Retroactive Public Goods Funding)** - a innovative funding mechanism that rewards contributors *after* they've already created value, rather than betting on what they might create in the future.

### What I've Researched So Far

- **🏛️ Optimism Ecosystem**: Understanding their grant infrastructure including Growth Grants, Milestones Council, and RetroPGF programs
- **💾 Filecoin Network**: Analysis of their evaluation processes using ~50 reviewers and automation techniques  
- **📊 Open Source Observer (OSO)**: Tools and methodologies for tracking public project metrics
- **⚙️ Automation Frameworks**: Exploring "vanilla metrics" that can be calculated using only on-chain and public data

### Key Research Insights

My interviews have revealed several important findings:
- **Application costs** are currently one of the biggest barriers in RetroPGF programs
- **Metric standardization** could significantly reduce evaluation workload
- **Universal metrics** (fees collected, TVL, token locks) could enable cross-ecosystem frameworks
- **Automated evaluation** could make programs more scalable and fair

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Map the Ecosystem**: Document current RetroPGF programs, their strengths, and pain points
2. **Identify Inefficiencies**: Find what's preventing RetroPGF rounds from being optimal and successful  
3. **Develop Solutions**: Create frameworks and tools to enhance the ecosystem
4. **Enable Automation**: Build systems that reduce manual evaluation overhead
