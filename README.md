# Onchain Recurrent Rewards Research & Development

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository contains the **research and development** of a project that aims to **map the current state of the public goods ecosystem** and contribute with possible enhancements to make it more effective and sustainable.

### My Goal

I'm exploring **RetroPGF (Retroactive Public Goods Funding)**, a creative funding method that rewards people after they've made valuable contributions. My goal is to enhance this system to be as automated, transparent, cost-effective, and data-driven as possible. This way, other DAOs and projects can begin compensating their open-source contributors more efficiently. Although I recognize that not every impact area can fully adopt these ideas, there's still a lot of room to make the current system better.

### 📊 Published Analyses

#### Measuring On-Chain Impact of RetroPGF Season 7
An exploratory causal analysis examining whether Optimism's RetroPGF Season 7 funding caused measurable increases in on-chain transaction activity for top-funded DEX projects (Uniswap, Aerodrome, Velodrome).

**Status:** 🚧 Ongoing - Currently collecting feedback

**Key Findings:**
- Applied Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) models to detect causal impact
- No statistically significant effects detected (p-values: 0.20-0.36)
- Results highlight methodological challenges and data requirements for impact measurement in crypto
- All code, data, and methodology shared openly for community learning
